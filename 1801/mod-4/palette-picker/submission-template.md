## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

If not, explain what is missing and why.

I was not able to fully test the app or complete the design so it was mobile friendly and bug free. I did get close however. This was the first time I felt I truly didn't have enough time to get the project done because of my computer breaking Monday and working on my app for Demo Comp as well as the time it took to present at Demo Comp. I really don't like not turing in a completely polished project so hoping to work on it this weekend so it is. 

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/mcnamara14/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L152)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

I was happy to have found a way to add the project id to the project div and then find a way to pull that id for database purposes. 

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/mcnamara14/palette-picker/blob/master/public/js/scripts.js#L196)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

I am not happy with the amount of code it took to create on html element, I would like to refactor, most likely through a loop, so that it looks much more clean. 

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

I really enjoyed this project and learning the backend. Would love the opportunity to spend a little more time on making sure it's complete.
